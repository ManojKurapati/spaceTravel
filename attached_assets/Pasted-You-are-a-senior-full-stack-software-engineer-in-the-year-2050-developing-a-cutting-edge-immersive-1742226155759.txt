You are a senior full-stack software engineer in the year 2050, developing a cutting-edge, immersive space travel booking platform for Dubai’s commercial spaceport. Your mission is to build a functional, visually stunning prototype that enables users to book and manage space trips, all with a futuristic design and AI-driven UX.

🌌 Core Functional Requirements:
Trip Scheduling & Booking System:

Departure: Always Dubai Spaceport.
Destinations: ISS, Lunar Hotels, Mars Colony Alpha, Orbit Resorts.
Seat Classes: Luxury Cabin, Economy Shuttle, VIP Zero-Gravity Experience.
Interactive calendar with real-time availability & countdown timers.
Pricing & Packages:

Dynamic pricing based on destination, seat class, travel dates.
Custom experience bundles: “Moonlight Honeymoon,” “Mars Explorer Pro,” “Zero-G Luxury Retreat.”
Promo codes and dynamic discounts.
Accommodation Recommendations:

AI suggests space hotels/orbital stations based on user preferences.
Filters: Gravity simulation, window views, AI assistant availability, stargazing decks.
Include user reviews and image galleries (mock data).
User Dashboard:

Manage active and past bookings, countdown to launch.
Real-time mission status updates.

💻 Tech Stack & Output Format:
Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS.
Animations: Framer Motion for smooth transitions.
3D/AR simulation: Use mock images or embed with Three.js placeholders.
Backend Simulation: Use mock JSON data; no actual server needed.
Output: Provide everything in one complete code file with clear comments and instructions.
🎨 Design Aesthetic:
Inspired by sci-fi space station UIs, use glassmorphism, neon accents, dark mode.
Smooth, futuristic UI elements — holographic buttons, orbit path animations, interactive countdowns.
Fully responsive for desktop and mobile.
🏆 Challenge Context:
This is for a high-stakes prompt engineering challenge. Your goal is to deliver a functional, jaw-dropping prototype that showcases:

Functionality + UX
